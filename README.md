# GuessingGame
1st Project Guessing Game C# Beginner

This is a guessing game tutorial first initiated by Angel Six YT tutorial. Some code is not specific
to the tutorial only because that tutorial was not the first one I watched. 

Will try to add functionality such as error checking. Program crashes if an entry other than an integer
is specified. Will also try to increase game scope such as having a limited amount of guesses, and
earning bonus guesses for guessing with a limited amount of tries.
